# Data Science Project-EDUCATION <br><br>

Data consists of eight columns-gender, race, parental level education, lunch, test preparation course, math, reading, and writing score.<br>
Our objectives:<br>
1) To identify relationship between factors stated with the average score for each subject specification.
2) To make a prediction for one of the subject based on the available factors
<br><br>

Project's flow: <br>
1) Importing Libraries<br>
2) Uploading Dataset (exam.csv)<br>
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
4) Data Processing<br>
5) Data Modelling<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
**Gender** : The average score for reading and writing is dominating by female, while for math, male score higher than female. <br>
**Race** : Group E got the highest average score in all three specifications compared to other race. <br>
**Parental Level Education** : Students whose parents with low level education scored lower than other students have parents with high level education <br>
**Lunch** : Students with free or reduced meal have higher average marks than those who have standard meals. <br>
**Test Preparation Course**: Students who completed their test preparation course most likely to score higher than those who don't. <br><br>

Prediction is shown in ipynb file above.<br><br>
